# Windpower Case Study

 An initial report from my analysis of the data presented in [SÃ¡nchez-Soriano et al., 2025](https://doi.org/10.3390/data10030038). I apply visualizations to look at power generation and capacity utilization with respect to differing site characteristics, weather conditions, temporal variations etc. I plan to expand further on this project with the inclusion of a dashboard, a predictive model and simulations.
